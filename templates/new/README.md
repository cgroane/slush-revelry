# revelry-harmonize

It's a lot of things,
but mostly it's a pre-canned way to set up universal-rendering Node apps
with React and Redux and Webpack and Gulp.

## Warning

It has a bunch of stupid `package.json` deps that are tied to my local filesystem.
Right now the only reason this repo exists is to keep me from losing my work.

## Coming soon...
